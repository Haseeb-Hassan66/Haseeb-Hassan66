# Haseeb Hassan

Computer Science undergraduate at **SIBA University**
Focused on core computer science fundamentals, structured problem-solving, and disciplined software development.  
Experienced in academic-scale projects involving C++, Java (OOP), and database-backed systems.  
Strong emphasis on correctness, clarity, and logic-first design rather than surface-level tooling.
