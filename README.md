## 🚀 Professional Summary
I am a **Computer Science** student at **Sukkur IBA University** with a focus on backend logic and desktop application architecture. My approach to development is defined by **precision and modularity**. I do not just write code that works; I engineer solutions that are readable, maintainable, and computationally efficient.

I specialize in **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** and high-performance logic using **C++ and Java**. My goal is to bridge the gap between abstract algorithmic theory and practical, robust software implementation.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
* **Logic Over Syntax:** Understanding the *why* and *how* of a system is more critical than the language syntax.
* **Modularity:** Building systems in isolated, testable components to ensure long-term maintainability.
* **Data Integrity:** Prioritizing efficient data storage and retrieval through optimized SQL queries and rigid data structures.
* **Optimization:** consistently analyzing time and space complexity to handle edge cases and performance bottlenecks.

---

## 🎓 Academic Focus
**Sukkur IBA University** — *Bachelor of Science in Computer Science*

I am currently deepening my expertise in system-level programming and application development. My academic rigor includes:
* **Advanced Data Structures:** Implementation of complex structures (AVL Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables) for optimized data handling.
* **Database Systems:** Relational database design, normalization, and ACID properties using MySQL.
* **Software Engineering:** Requirement analysis, version control (Git), and architectural patterns.
